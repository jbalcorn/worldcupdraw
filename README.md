If FIFA needs code to complete the WC draw....

In 2010 I wrote a perl script to create WC Groups based on FIFA's pots and rules. I updated it in 2014, where the creation rules got REALLY interesting...

In 2018 I decided to rewrite it in PowerShell and discovered that the non-geographic pots made the code REALLY difficult.  9 hours of work finally came up with code the correctly creates legal, random groups every time.
